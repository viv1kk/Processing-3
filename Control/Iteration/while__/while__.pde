//************************************************* while() ********************************************//

//Description

//Controls a sequence of repetitions. 
//The while structure executes a series of statements continuously while the expression is true. 
//The expression must be updated during the repetitions or the program will never "break out" of while. 

//This function can be dangerous because the code inside the while loop will not finish until the expression inside while becomes false. 
//It will lock out all other code from running (e.g., mouse and keyboard events will not be updated). 
//Be careful â€” if used incorrectly, this can lock up your code (and sometimes even the Processing environment itself).

//Syntax

//while (expression) {
//  statements
//}

//Parameters

//expression  a valid expression
//statements  one or more statements
